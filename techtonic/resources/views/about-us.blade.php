        <p class="card-text">The clothes make the man. Perhaps no historical figure lived this concept quite
          like Louis XIV. With his dizzying
          renovation of Versailles in the late 1600s, and his establishment of a court culture with a strict
          and lavish dress
          code, the French king equated a man’s possessions with his power.
          By wearing a luxury watch, you are also joining a truly exclusive club. After all, these are the watches worn
          by presidents, Hollywood stars, and royalty.

          But how to choose the best luxury watch for you? How to decide between a traditional and refined timepiece and
          something more cutting-edge and avant-garde?

          A good place to start is with this list of the 55 best luxury watch brands today. This list was created based
          on detailed research to identify the luxury brands that enjoy a global reputation for delivering high-quality
          timepieces. A demonstration of exquisite craftsmanship, incomparable aesthetic sensibility, and a passion for
          pushing boundaries have distinguished these brands as the best luxury watchmakers today.
